# Motor Assisted Commutator for High-fidelity Electro- and Opto-Physiological Tethered Experiments (MACHETE) 

Designed by members of the [Pégard](https://www.nicolaspegard.com/) and [Rodríguez-Romaguera](https://www.rodriguezromagueralab.org/) Labs at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, **MACHETE** is a motor assisted commutator that allows researchers to capture high-fidelity electro- and opto-physiological data during tethered freely-moving behavior experiments with mice. 


# Custom Arduino Printed Circuit Board Shield:
Our motor assisted commutator is driven and controlled by an Arduino Nano 3.x, integrated within a pair of custom printed circuit boards (PCBs) which 



2560 microcontroller board, with a custom printed circuit board (PCB) Arduino shield with built-in resistance, interactive feedback LEDs, real-time clock compatibility, and screw hole terminals. The printed circuit board shield expands the capabilities of the microcontroller board and allows for greater stability than a conventional solderless circuit board. The Arduino shield allows users to interface with each of the components of the **CaPuLeT** GUI.
