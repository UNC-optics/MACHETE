# Motor Assisted Commutator for High-fidelity Electro- and Opto-Physiological Tethered Experiments (MACHETE) 

Designed by members of the [Pégard](https://www.nicolaspegard.com/) and [Rodríguez-Romaguera](https://www.rodriguezromagueralab.org/) Labs at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, **MACHETE** is a motor assisted commutator that allows researchers to capture high-fidelity electro- and opto-physiological data during tethered freely-moving behavior experiments with mice.

# Custom Arduino Printed Circuit Board Shield:
Our motor assisted commutator is driven and controlled by an Arduino Nano 3.x, integrated within a pair of custom printed circuit boards (PCBs) which allow users to interface with both data aquisition computers and existing commercial optogenetic and electrophysiological devices.
